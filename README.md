Employee Database


Why are we doing this?

To implement what we have learned from our QA training which included javascript to tackle a real life problem.

How I expected the challenge to go.

I expected the challenge to be ok as we had enough time to tackle bits of the problem.

What went well?

I was able to break down the task into smaller chunks of problems and be able to tackle them which made the project easier to complete.

What didn't go as planned?

I didn't fully understand the functionality of some pieces of code which made it harder when I tried to add further features.

Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.

I should spend more time understanding the code properly and planning the structure of my project so that I can implement additional features more easily
